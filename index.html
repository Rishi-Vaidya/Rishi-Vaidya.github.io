                            <p>I am a Computer Science BSc graduate with First Class Honours, bringing over three years of hands-on academic experience in software development, 
                                data analysis, and problem-solving. Throughout my studies, I developed a strong technical foundation while also cultivating the creativity and adaptability
                                 needed to approach challenges from new perspectives.

                                My academic journey has given me opportunities to work on diverse projectsâ€”ranging from building distributed systems and RESTful services to designing machine 
                                learning models and data-driven applications. These experiences not only strengthened my programming and analytical skills but also enhanced my ability to collaborate

                        <p>During July of 2021, I spent time at Pitney Bowes learning about the importance of User Experience and User Interfaces
                            when creating applications and websites. I spent time with members of the UI/UX team who provided insight on their design processes and user research methodologies.
                            I was also given the opportunity to learn how these skills could be applied to larger scale projects and the impact they can have on user satisfaction and engagement.
                            Finally, I was lucky enough to be able to meet with multiple senior officials at the company during the time such as global marketing officers who were able to provide
                            a really helpful business perspective on the importance of user-centered design as well as providing useful tips on how they made it to where they are. As a result of 
                            this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of the significance of UI/UX in the tech industry and how it can be leveraged to create more effective and user-friendly

                            preparing me for the tech industry, with a strong foundation in software development, data analysis, and user-centered design principles. During my studies, I worked on various
                            projects that involved Web Development and Design, creating RESTful services, implementing machine learning algorithms, creating AI chatbots, and developing mobile applications.
                            As well as this, I gained experience in Agile methodologies, version control systems, and collaborative development environments, which are essential skills in today's tech landscape.
                            These were achieved through a combination of coursework, group projects, and individual assignments that challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

                        <p>For my Final year project during my time at University, I developed a comprehensive system for tracking and analyzing table tennis matches. Created through
                            the use of Python and OpenCV, I successfully built a tool that was able to detect the table tennis ball and track its movement across the table whilst also 
                            registering all bounce points within the tables area. With this data I was able to provide valuable insights into player performance and match dynamics through
                            the use of data visualization techniques such as 2D and 3D Heatmaps. This project not only enhanced my programming and computer vision skills but also deepened 
                            my understanding of sports analytics.
